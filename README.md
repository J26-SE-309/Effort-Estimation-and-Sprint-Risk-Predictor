# Effort Estimation and Sprint Risk Predictor

> A microservice of **Synapse**, an AI-assisted agile project platform built by research group **J26-SE-309**.

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-initial%20setup-orange)

## Overview

This service estimates the effort needed for backlog items and predicts risks to sprint delivery, so teams can plan sprints with realistic commitments.

Scope, methodology, datasets and models will be documented here as the research progresses.

## Repository Layout (planned)

```
Effort-Estimation-and-Sprint-Risk-Predictor/
├── backend/     # Service API consumed by Synapse-Web
└── ml-engine/   # Model training, evaluation and inference
```

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J26-SE-309/Effort-Estimation-and-Sprint-Risk-Predictor.git
cd Effort-Estimation-and-Sprint-Risk-Predictor
```

Setup and run instructions will be added once the backend and ML engine are scaffolded.
